// so some background information on how this works
// when you give this item to multiple player it seems like every player contains the exact same instance of the item
// when player A consumes 1 item, it will also be gone for playerB
// However, this is all done by this system, but they are not really the same item.
// When creating an item with the itemFactory, besides the item, they also get a custom id assigned to it
// and because this item contains 1 itemStack that never get switched out, this id always stays the same
// so when playerA makes changes to this item, this change will cause a search through every player that contains an item with the same ID
// and if found, that same change will be applied to them. thus making it look like the same instance

// a lot of methods are open just so you can override them. that does not mean you should though
// I just don't want to ruin your freedom once this is a library, and you can't change the source code
// in almost all cases you want to put the super.myMethod() at the end of the override to make it not break
