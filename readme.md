TODO: to set up this template you will have to change the "template" everywhere to your thing name,
  so that is in:
 1. in settings.gradle
 2. folder/directory name
 3. @Plugin at the top of this class
 4. title in this companion object
 5. maybe class name (instead of MinecraftPlugin, you could do TemplatePlugin)

Everything then should work still
yuo can build the plugin jar with the little hammer icon next to the run button
this would build it automatically, I think using the gradle settings (so you don't have to mess with artifact or anything)
the jar will be located in build/libs/Template-1.0.jar

You can just go to githup and press the button "use as template" and create a repo via that
